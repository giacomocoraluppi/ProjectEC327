Protect the Planet is an entertainment game made for EC327 as a way to demonstate our understanding of C++. In the game, asteroids are spawn from the edge of the screen as the player avoids being hit by shooting the asteroids before they collide with the planet or ship. 
The game can be used by anyone for entertainment purposes. Protect the Planet is on the agenda everyday.
