Protect the Planet is a symbolic game made for EC327 as a way to demonstate our understanding of C++. In the game, asteroids are spawn from the edge of the screen as the player avoids being hit by shooting the asteroids before they collide with the planet or ship. 
The game is meant to be used by anyone wanting to experience symbolism in coding. Our "Protect the Planet" game is a minimization of an issue. But truly protecting the Planet is on the agenda everyday.
