Protect the Planet is an entertainment game made for EC327 as a way to demonstrate our understanding of C++. In the game, asteroids spawn from the edge of the screen as the player avoids being hit by shooting the asteroids before they collide with the planet or ship. The game is controlled by using the WASD keys on the keyboard. Protect the Planet can be used by anyone for entertainment purposes in digital gaming. It is most catered to kids from the ages of 3-17. Protecting the Planet is on the agenda everyday!
